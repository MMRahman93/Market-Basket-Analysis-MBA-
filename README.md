# Market-Basket-Analysis-MBA-
Market Basket Analysis for Consumer Items, Where the Customers are Dealers and Distributors of the Company
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data using Market Basket Analysis (MBA), a powerful technique widely used in data science and retail analytics. The goal of MBA is to identify associations between items frequently purchased together, providing valuable insights for product placement, cross-selling, and marketing strategies.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of sales order information obtained from a retail database. It includes details such as order ID, item ID, item name, order quantity, order date, and customer ID.

**Analysis Steps:**

**Data Preprocessing:**
The dataset is cleaned and filtered to remove invalid or missing entries.
Date columns are converted to the appropriate data type for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Visualizations are generated to understand sales trends, including monthly order quantity and value.
Top-selling items are identified based on order quantity and order value.

**Association Rule Mining:**
The Apriori algorithm is applied to discover frequent item sets and association rules.
Rules are evaluated based on support, confidence, and lift metrics to identify meaningful associations between items.

**Findings:**
The most ordered item is identified as "Rice Bran Boiled 1K (T)", while the most frequent item is "Miniket 25K (T)".
A frequent item set consisting of "Soybean Oil Fortified 1L", "Soybean Oil Fortified 5L", and "Soybean Oil Fortified 2L" is discovered, indicating a strong association between these items.
Conclusion:

Market Basket Analysis offers valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior, allowing retailers to optimize product assortments and enhance sales strategies.
The findings from this analysis can be leveraged to improve product recommendations, optimize inventory management, and design targeted marketing campaigns.
